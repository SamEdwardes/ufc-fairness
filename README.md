# Is the UFC Fair?

Assessing the fairness of UFC judging.

The original data was obtained from Kaggle user [Rajeev
Warrier](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw) (Rajeev Warrier 2019). The data
has also been downloaded and uploaded to a [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/ufc-data) to avoid issues for users
who do not have Kaggle accounts. This project was started during my
Masters of Data Science at the University of British Columbia (Sarah
Weber, Subing Cao, Sam Edwardes 2020).
